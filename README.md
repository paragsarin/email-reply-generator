# ðŸ“§ Reply EMail Generator
The reply email generator enables users to create responses to client emails that address their concerns about a claim. It also provides a summary of the email and indicates its tone.

## Set-up
1. To get started we first need to get an API_KEY from here: https://console.groq.com/keys. Inside `app/.env` update the value of `GROQ_API_KEY` with the API_KEY you created. 


2. To get started, first install the dependencies using:
    ```commandline
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```   
3. Run the streamlit app:
   ```commandline
   streamlit run app/main.py
   ```
